			<h1>The Big Cats of the World; All at Risk</h1>
			<h2> Tigers, Jaguars, Snow Leopards, and Lions</h2>
			</header>
			
			<main>
				<p>A "big cat" is considered to be any of the large members of the cat family, 
			including the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, clouded leopard, cheetah, and cougar.</p>
			
			<p> Big cats live all over the world. They can be found as far north as Canada and as Far south as South africa</p>
			
			<h3> Bikes and Tigers</h3> <!-- Tigers-->
			
			<p> In Asia, wire and cable from bicycles is being re-purposed 
			into deadly snare traps – increasingly found in big cat habitats. 
			This illegal hunting method is actually killing 
			more big cats than guns across the Asian continent.</p>
			
			<h3>Soybeans and Jaguars </h3> <!-- Jaguars-->
			
			<p> Soybeans  are not directly threatening South America’s largest cat. 
			But much of their habitat is being cleared to make room for large farms and their crops, like soy. 
			Due to their elusive nature it is not known how many jaguars are left in the wild,
			but it is known their numbers are declining, with habitat loss a major reason.</p>
			
			<h3> Livestock and Snow Leopards</h3> <!--Leopards-->
			<p> Why would want to kill a member of this snowy white species>? An angry herder who has just lost
			 his livestock to a hungry snow leopard may be likely to kill them to protect the future livestock.
			 In fact, with human and livestock populations growing, killings are as great a threat to snow leopards as poaching. </p>
			 
			 
			<h3> Bones and Lions </h3> <!-- Lions-->
			<p> You might have heard the rumor that tiger bones can cure all illnesses.
			 But with wild tiger populations low due to poaching, recent studies shows lion bone being substituted 
			in traditional Asian medicine – bringing yet another threat to lions. </p>
