			scattered on a area of 290 square miles!</p>

	<h3><u> Fly over The Nazca Lines</u></h3> <!-- Nazca lines and pictures of them-->
	<p>The only way to have a real good point of view and fly over Nazca lines by plane, 
	with a ride in Cesna that lasts about 30 minutes and allows you to see almost all 12 figures. But Be careful, 
	planes do not always take off. Depending on the day's weather conditions, the flight 
	may be delayed. If you are planning on taking a flight, it is recommended that you still plan events for the day incase of bad weather. </p>

	<h2>Cemetery of Chauchilla</h2><!-- Cemetery Description-->
	<p>The cemetery is one of the most popular attractions outside the Nazca lines. It is a large cemetery of the Inca-Chincha culture , 
	which dates from about the year 900 AC.The cemetery was raided by the huaqueros, "the grave robbers", but the bodies were still
	well preserved.  The well preserved bodies were wrapped in cotton, then covered with resin and kept in adobe graves. 
	They are so well preserved that 1000 years later, some bodies still have hair and skin.</p>

	<h2>Cahuachi</h2>
	<p><q><i> Another great pre-Inca ceremonial centre Cahuachi, at 24 sq. km, 36 temples, and 36 pyramids,
	 is easily the largest pre-Inca site yet uncovered in Peru. It is a bone-jarring 
	hour ride to get there but <b>this Nasca ceremonial centre is worth the effort.</b></q></i> - Tsmada W., Canada<p>
	<p>Cahuachi is the most important Nazca center discovered to date. It was a sacred place, where priests and other elite lived, and where 
	visitors came on pilgrimages. It held many religious ceremonies and sacrifices to ensure the protection of the gods.</p>
