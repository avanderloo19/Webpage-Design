		<h3> THE LOOKS OF THE GERENUK</h3>
		<p>The long neck and long, thin legs of gerenuks are the features they are most known for and therefore
		make them one of the world's most recognizable antelopes. The <b>fur is a pale</b>
		brown with white along the stomach and inner legs. There are smaller,
		darker spots of fur on the knees of the forelegs and at the end of their tail. The 
		head is small with larger ears. On the head there is a dark spot around the eyes
		Only males of this species have small horns. Both genders are similar in size but 
		the <b>males have more muscules</b> than females causing them to weigh more than their 
		female counterparts. </p>
		
		
		<h3>GERENUK DESCRIPTION</h3>
		<p> A Gerenuk is a type of antelope that belongs to the <b>bovid family.</b> There 
		are two subspecies of gerenuk that can be found in Africa, usually in the East. 
		Gerenuks inhabit semi-arid areas, deserts and dry bushy savannas. The number of 
		gerenuks in the wild is decreasing due to the uncontrolled hunting and habitat 
		destruction by humans. Gerenuk is classified as <b>near threatened</b>, which means that 
		it can become endangered in the near future.</p>

		<h3>CONSERVATION</h3>
		<p> Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by humans are currently the main 
		dangers to the gerenuk populations. The gerenuk is presently listed as Near Threatened 
		for conservation status, and an estimated 95,000 remain among four countries. Purposeful 
		wildlife conservation has kept gerenuks from becoming an endangered species.</p>
		<p>As human populations grow, they expand settlements, roads, and agriculture, 
		resulting in lost or segmented habitats for gerenuks and other wildlife. This 
		makes it more difficult for them to find food, shelter themselves from predators, 
		and locate any mates For more information please visit <a href="https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/gerenuk" target="_blank">The Saint Louis Zoo</a></P>
		<P> <b> SOLUTIONS FROM AMERICAN WILDLIFE FOUNDATION (AWF) . . .</b></P>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Work with governments.</b></li>
				African Wildlife Foundation engages with government entities to help plan 
				and propose alternative solutions to habitat fragmentation. In the case 
				of the Serengeti Highway, we provide our scientists and researchers as 
				resources to assist in proper planning to ensure a balance between 
				modernization and conservation.</p>
		
		<p>
			<li><b>Expand conservation tourism.</b></li>
				AWF brings together private investors and communities to construct tourism
				 lodges like Satao Elerai, a luxury lodge situated on 5,000 acres in Kenya.
				  The land is protected, so gerenuks and other wildlife can roam safely and 
				  freely, and the revenue is reinvested into the community and into local
				 wildlife conservation.
